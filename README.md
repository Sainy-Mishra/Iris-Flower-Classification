# Iris_Flower_Classification
Iris flower has three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here my task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
